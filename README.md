# autoload4grammy

## What is this?

This is a plugin for the grammY framework to autoload certain bot modules based on the file structure.

## What for?

I don't know about others, but I, the developer of this plugin,
somewhat dislike the bot's main file (for example, src/bot.ts)
bloated with imports. However, I like when the structure of the application
is based on the directory structure and when it automatically collects into a heap.
Although, I have to admit, this is not always a good solution,
so I think it is important to implement it in the form of a plugin, and not a built-in feature.
